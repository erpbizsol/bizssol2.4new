#### <i>Prerequisites</i>
Before begin, make sure development environment includes `Node.jsÂ®` and an `npm` package manager.

###### Node.js
[**Angular 17**](https://angular.io/guide/what-is-angular) requires `Node.js` LTS version `^18.13` or `^20.09`.

- To check node version, run `node -v` in a terminal/console window.
- To get `Node.js`, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

###### Angular CLI

Install the Angular CLI globally using a terminal/console window.
npm install -g @angular/cli


### Installation

$ npm install
$ npm update


### Basic usage

``` bash
# dev server with hot reload at http://localhost:4200
$ npm start
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). The app will automatically reload if we change any of the source files.

#### Build

Run `build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

```bash
# build for production with minification
$ npm run build

## Documentation

The documentation for the lead Management is in the process.

This project is generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if we change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. we can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of our choice. To use this command, we need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
